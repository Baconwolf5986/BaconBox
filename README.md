# BaconBox
A game engine/framework that is used to create 2D games using 3D models and textures. Made using C++ with DirectX12 and Windows APIs. 

## Purpose
Created with the guidance of Frank Luna's book: "Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12"
- Learn real time rendering programming with modern graphics APIs.
- Baseline for learning rendering techniques and algorithms

## Goals
- Create rendering pipelines for foreground and background
- Develop in 3D with realistic lighting
- Shaders to convert 3D scene to 2D screen

## Current Intended Functions (Not Implemented)
- Insert existing models using common file formats for meshes (OBJ, etc.)
- Animate 3D models
